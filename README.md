## Overview
This is the main website for Thrive Dental Malaysia - a dental clinic aimed at providing specialized service to the aging community in Malaysia. The site has one single page with the intention of giving quick information for potential customers including pictures of the clinic and the company's contact information. It is aimed at being a beautiful but simple project. As such, there is minimal interactivity - users need to call or email the company directly as there is no SMTP server to handle emails. 

This site is built on React. Modules used include React Router Hash Link (smooth scroll) and Styled Components (CSS). Deployed version of the website can be viewed here: [https://thrivedental.com.my/](https://thrivedental.com.my/)

## Running the app
cd client

yarn install

yarn start

## Next Steps
1. Fix the smooth scroll feature. Right now when a section is clicked, the smooth scroll does not scroll to the top of the section and usually scrolls past. This is a problem especially for the contact section. [TESTING]
